## Happiness Feedback Loop
It is heard time and time again that money can’t buy happiness. However, the main strategy for many countries to promote happiness is to increase its GDP. While these two statements seem contradictory, that line of thinking holds some truth as the happiest countries also have the highest GDP. But, this is not the whole story as the UN’s Global Happiness Report has found that many of the most affluent nations are actually declining in happiness. These reports indicate that the relationship between GDP and happiness is actually reversed due to the fact that happier people are more engaged and productive and that this increased productivity is what actually drives GDP growth.

This happiness feedback loop can be illustrated using Venezuela as a specific example to evaluate how happiness scores change in response to public policy as it has seen some dramatic changes in the past 10 years. In 2014, it was ranked the 22nd happiest country in the world. Since then, it has fallen 85 spots to 107th and made international headlines with growing concerns over its current socioeconomic crisis.

These three graphs represent the three points on the happiness feedback loop. The graph at the top of the screen displays the change in Venezuela’s socioeconomic equality from 2006 to 2018. The graph in the bottom right of the screen displays its happiness scores over that same time period and the graph in the bottom left displays its GDP. Beginning with GDP, we can see a sharp increase between 2006-2008. As Venezuela is one of the world’s leading oil exporters, this is most likely in response to the rebound of oil prices in the early 2000’s. This increase in revenue then funded numerous populist social policies that dramatically decreased wealth inequality, as shown by the steep drop in the yellow line in the top graph. This decrease in inequality corresponds with an increase in national happiness as displayed in the bottom right graph.

Happiness scores remained high until 2013, when a contested election following the death of Hugo Chavez and widespread corruption sent the country on its current downward spiral.  The sharp increase seen in the inequality measure aligns with the drastic decrease in both the nation’s happiness scores and GDP. To frame this in the context of the happiness feedback loop. Rising levels of inequality have lead to an unhappy and unproductive economy, which has in turn resulted in a decrease in GDP and thus fewer available funds to invest in prosocial public policies and projects.
